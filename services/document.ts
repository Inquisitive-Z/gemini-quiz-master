Development and Application of Artificial Intelligence
By Zheng Cao

Abstract. Artificial intelligence is an emerging science, which studies and develops theoretical
methods and techniques for simulating and expanding human intelligence. Today, artificial
intelligence has made significant achievements in pattern recognition, knowledge engineering,
robotics, etc. But it is far from the real human intelligence. Based on the elaboration of the concept
of artificial intelligence, this study analyzes the development history, the current applicable fields of
artificial intelligence, and looks forward to the future development trend. Meanwhile, we discuss the
ethical dilemma faced or about to be faced by artificial intelligence technology.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence is a new discipline based on the interdisciplinary nature of computer science,
cybernetics, information theory, psychology, linguistics and philosophy. It is mainly used to study
how to use machines (mainly computers) to imitate and realize human's intelligent behaviors.
Intelligence is the unique feature of human beings different from the general characteristics of
biological. It can be interpreted as human ability of perception, learning, understanding and thinking.
Artificial intelligence is a discipline that studies, understands, simulates human intelligence, and
discovers its laws.
As an important branch of computer science, artificial intelligence was formally proposed by
McCarthy at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956 and is currently referred to as one of the
world's three cutting-edge technologies. Professor Nilsson, working at the famous Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in the United States, defines artificial intelligence: “Artificial
intelligence is a subject of knowledge - how to express and acquire and use knowledge.” Professor
Winston at MIT said that “artificial intelligence is the study, how to make computers do what can
only be achieved by human intelligence in the past".
Based on the elaboration of the concept of artificial intelligence, this study analyzes the
development history and the current applicable fields of artificial intelligence, and looks forward to
the future of the development trend. At the same time, we discuss the ethical dilemma faced or about
to be faced by artificial intelligence technology.

2. Origin and Development of Artificial Intelligence
Since birth, human beings keep trying to use the machines to replace part of human brain works
according to the contemporary level of knowledge and technical conditions. After a long period of
development of science and technology, until entering the 20th century, some groundbreaking work
occurred in the area artificial intelligence. A historic conference in 1956 at Dartmouth College in the
United States was considered a sign of the birth of artificial intelligence science. During the
conference McCarthy formally introduced the concept of artificial intelligence, which involves
mathematics, computer, neurophysiology, psychology and other disciplines. From that point the
artificial intelligence technology, as a formal emerging discipline, began to thrive.
Since the 1960s, research on artificial intelligence has been paid more and more attention.
Researchers have conducted in-depth research on the applications of artificial intelligence such as
problem solving, game theory, theorem proving, and program design. In May 1997, Deep Blue
developed by IBM, with the score of 3.5:2.5, defeated the chess world champion for the first time in the official game, causing a worldwide sensation. This indicates that in some areas, artificial
intelligence systems can reach the highest level of human beings. In March 2016, Google's Alpha Go
beat the international go master Lee Se-dol 4:1, again conquering the world with superb chess skills
and stunning performance. In the current background of big data, these events make human beings
placed unlimited hope on artificial intelligence, meanwhile lost into the endless reflection.

3. Applications and Development Trend of Artificial Intelligence
After several decades of development, artificial intelligence technology has been used in many
fields of today's society. We explore several typical applications of artificial intelligence and the
future direction of development.
3.1 Problem Solving
Chess program (such as chess and go) that can solve difficult problems is a major achievement of
artificial intelligence. The search strategy can be classified as blind search without informational
guidance and heuristic search using empirical knowledge, which is determining the priority relation
of knowledge in the reasoning step of problem solving. One unresolved question includes the
expressional ability of human players, such as the ability of chess masters to gain insight into the
chess game. Another unresolved question involves the Meta concept of problems, which is called the
selection of problem representation in artificial intelligence, i.e. human beings are always able to find
a way to think about the problem so that the solution becomes easy and eventually solve the problem.
3.2 Machine Learning
Machine Learning studies how to use computers to simulate or achieve human learning activities.
It is an important application area of artificial intelligence. Learning is an important feature of human
intelligence and basic means of access to knowledge. Machine learning is a fundamental way to make
the computer intelligent. In addition, machine learning also helps to discover the mechanisms of
human learning and reveal the mystery of the human brain. Learning is a process of knowledge
acquisition with a specific purpose. Its internal performance is mainly the continuous establishment
and modification of the new knowledge structure, and the external performance is the improvement
of performance. Essentially, a learning process is that a learning system transforming the information
provided by the mentor (or expert) into a form that can be understood and applied by itself. According
to the degree of the system's dependency on the mentor, the learning methods can be categorized as:
Rote Learning, Learning from Instruction, Learning by Analogy, Learning from Induction, and
Learning by Observation and Discovery, etc.
3.3 Expert System
Expert system is another important branch in the field of artificial intelligence research. It explores
the application of general thinking method to the use of specialized knowledge to solve the special
problems, and realizes the breakthrough of artificial intelligence from theoretical research to practical
application. The expert system can be seen as a class of specialized computer intelligent program
system, which can use the expertise and experience from experts in specific fields. The intelligent
program system can use reasoning techniques in artificial intelligence to solve and simulate complex
problems, which can usually be solved only by experts. In general, expert system is a kind of
intelligent software, whose solution method is a heuristic one. Problems solved by expert system have
generally no algorithm solution. It is different from the traditional computer program. Expert system
often concludes based on incomplete, inaccurate or uncertain information.
3.4 Neural Network
Artificial neural network, consisting of a large number of interconnected processing units
(neurons), is briefly referred to as neural network. Neural network is an arithmetic model composed
of a large number of interconnected nodes (or neurons). It is an abstraction and simulation of some
basic characteristics of human brain or natural neural network. The purpose of neural network is to
simulate some of the mechanisms of the brain to achieve functions in some aspects. In detail, the
artificial neural network is a technology that aims at solutions of a specific problem, uses the grasp
of the biological neural network mechanism, accords with the idea of control engineering and
mathematical description method, establishes corresponding mathematical models, uses appropriate algorithms and determines the mathematical model parameters. The information processing of neural
network is realized by the interaction between neurons. The storage of knowledge and information
mainly manifests itself as the physical relation between network elements. Artificial neural network
has a strong self-learning ability. It doesn't need to rely on the “expert” mind. Instead, it automatically
summarizes the law from the existing experimental data. Thus, the artificial neural network is good
at dealing with complex multidimensional nonlinear problems.
3.5 Pattern Recognition
Pattern recognition in artificial intelligence means using computers to substitute for or help
humans to percept patterns. The main research object is the computer pattern recognition system, i.e.
to make the computer system to simulate the human perception through the sensory organs. Earlier
pattern recognition researches focused on the recognition of text and two-dimensional images, and
achieved many results. Since the mid-1960s, researches of machine vision have begun to turn to the
more difficult topic of explaining and describing complex 3D scenes. The hotspot of the current
research is the identification and analysis of targets in locomotion (such as an aircraft), which is a
sign of the fact that the scene analysis is towards practical research.
As an emergent discipline, pattern recognition is in the continuous development, as well as its
theoretical basis and scope of research. Thriving at present, the pattern recognition technology will
be developed deeper in the future with the extension of its scope and development of computer science.
Quantum computing technology will also be used in the study of pattern recognition.

4. The Ethical Dilemma Faced by Artificial Intelligence
With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the products are not limited to
the production area and begin to gradually integrate into the field of life. Therefore, artificial
simulation intelligent robot comes into being. They have the appearance increasingly close to that of
human beings, which represents the further approach from artificial intelligence to human intelligence.
The increasingly close relationship between the intelligent robot and humans triggered a series of
ethical issues. As one of the leading manufacturers of artificial intelligence technology, Google, in
2014, first set up an artificial intelligence ethics committee to ensure that artificial intelligence
technology is not abused. Many research experts have publicly expressed the concern about the threat
from artificial intelligence to human beings. In the huge ethical knowledge system, combined with
the actual situation of artificial intelligence, the following ethical issues are mainly involved.
4.1 Should the Human Rights Be Given to Machines That Are “Human"?
Safeguarding human rights is a fundamental moral principle of today's society. The rapid
development of artificial intelligence technology makes smart robots who were engaged only in
simple physical activity in the past have a certain degree of perception and is given so-called “human
nature". Along with the emergence of these “smart lives”, human rights have faced significant
challenge. Intelligent robots achieve their actions through the computer programming codes, and they
are made as close as possible to the behavior of people through the complex, different algorithms.
With the popularization of intelligent robots, the discussion of whether or not to give them “human
rights" has also become heated. There are opponents who argue that we do not need powerful
intelligent robots in our life, and they should not be given “human rights”. If robots have the so-called
“human rights”, the “three rules of the robot” will be violated, which is indulgence of robots and
indirect damage to human beings. On the other hand, supporters maintain that if robots are able to
have moral cultivation and autonomous interaction with human beings, then “human rights” is what
they deserve.
4.2 How to Locate Intelligent Robots' Moral Status
Since we referred to the human rights ethical issues brought by artificial intelligence, it is
inevitable to accurately locate its social moral status. The so-called moral status is based on the unique
spiritual characteristics of human beings. With the emergence of artificial intelligence, we have to
defend its moral rights, especially when the robots with human emotions emerge. When they have a
considerable "human nature”, they should have a corresponding moral status.
In the human society, once the rest of the members have a moral status, it means that mankind has
a moral responsibility. If we deny the moral status of intelligent robots, we can treat them in any way
we like, which can be friendly or harsh and brutal. An individual who has human rights, or a group
with corresponding rights, should be treated morally. Imagine that if one day an intelligent robot
belonging to our own is subjected to inhumane abuse at home or outside and unfairly treated like
some animals today. Is this situation still consistent with the traditional ethics we insist on? As the
masters of society, we must always understand that not only human beings have moral demands.
When we have robots do dirty works we do not want to do, or when we endlessly ask robots to do
things for us, do we have justification for our behavior?

5. Conclusion
Artificial intelligence is always at the forefront of computer science, and its theories and results
will control science and technology to a large extent and determine the direction of computer
technology development. Nowadays, there are many results of artificial intelligence research involved
into people's daily life. In the future, the development of artificial intelligence technology will
certainly bring long-term and profound impact to people's work, life and education. However,
research in the field of artificial intelligence's ethics should also keep pace with its technology. People
should take precautions and meanwhile avoid excessive sensitivity.
